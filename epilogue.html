<p>It only takes one person to create a hostile and threatening environment. While there are things you can do to deal with stressors, the only sure way to avoid being harassed is not to be in the same place as harassers. Unfortunately, this is not as easy as it sounds for many people around the world.</p>


<p>After playing this game, we hope you have a greater understanding of the experience of fear that many individuals face on a daily basis, doing things as simple as walking home.  If you'd like to help minimize these experiences, here are a few things that you can do.
<ol>
<li>Think before you act. Think about the consequences of the things you say and do.</li>
<li>Speak up against discriminatory language and behavior when you notice it. You can create safe spaces for the people around you.</li>
<li>If someone points out your own language or behavior, please understand that it is nothing about you as a person, but that the things you do hurt others. Be responsive to such notes.</li>
<li>Educate yourself about victim blaming and rape culture. While we don't intend this game to address a specific kind of harassment, educating yourself about these particular ideas can give you resources to address other forms of discrimination and hate speech.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Here are some links to help you on your journey. Many of these address street harassment towards women, from the perspective of women who have personal experience with it. There are many other forms of harassment out there, but all of these start in a lack of respect for the individual:
